k Means clustering 2D interactive demo
========================

A simple interactive demo of how kMeans clustering works in 2D.

Click on the canvas to add new instances (rectangles).
Change the color for the next rectangle by clicking on change color.
You can delete individual rectangles by clicking on them, or you can delete all rectangles by clicking on the Clear button.\n"+
When you are satisfied with you dataset click Start clustering.\n"+
"Continue clicking next step until the clustering converges.\n"+

I made it while I was a student as homework in Pattern Recognition.

Here are some images
